title: Excuses For A Friend Not To Come Over
---

I'm sure we've all been there. You've invited a friend over and they've come up with a million excuses not to come. It can be really frustrating, especially if you've been looking forward to seeing them. But sometimes, it's just not possible for your friend to come over. Here are some of the most common excuses your friend may give for not coming over:

1. They're too busy.

This is probably the most common excuse. We all have busy lives and sometimes it's just not possible to fit in a visit with a friend. If your friend is already over-scheduled, they may not be able to fit in a visit with you.

2. They don't feel well.

If your friend is feeling under the weather, they may not be up to coming over. It's important to respect their decision and not pressure them into coming if they're not feeling well.

3. They're feeling shy.

Sometimes, your friend may be feeling shy or anxious about coming over. This is totally understandable and it's important to be understanding and supportive.

4. They're worried about money.

If your friend is on a tight budget, they may not be able to afford to come over. This is especially true if you live in an area with high transportation costs.

5. They're feeling overwhelmed.

Sometimes, life can be overwhelming and your friend may not be up to socializing. It's important to be understanding and supportive if this is the case.

No matter what the excuse is, it's important to be understanding and supportive of your friend. It's also important to remember that it's okay to take a break from socializing. Everyone needs time to themselves and it's important to respect that.
