---

As someone who has had to come up with a good excuse and sell it more times than I can count, I know it can be a daunting task. But it doesn't have to be. With a few tips and tricks, you can come up with a good excuse and sell it with ease. 

The first step in coming up with a good excuse is to be honest. While it may be tempting to make up a story, it's important to be honest and upfront about the situation. This will help you come up with a more believable excuse and will make it easier to sell it. 

The next step is to think of a plausible excuse. It should be something that is believable and that you can explain in detail. For example, if you are late for an appointment, you could say that you got stuck in traffic or that you had a flat tire. 

Once you have an excuse, it's time to sell it. The key to selling an excuse is to be confident and to make sure that you are telling the truth. It's also important to be sincere and to show that you are sorry for the inconvenience. 

Finally, it's important to make sure that you follow through with your excuse. If you say that you got stuck in traffic, make sure that you show up on time the next time. This will help to prove that your excuse was valid and that you are taking responsibility for your actions. 

By following these tips, you can come up with a good excuse and sell it with ease. Just remember to be honest, think of a plausible excuse, and be confident when you explain it. With a little bit of practice, you'll be able to come up with a good excuse and sell it in no time.
