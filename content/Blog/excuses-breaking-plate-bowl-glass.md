title: Excuses For Breaking A Plate Bowl Glass
---

I recently had the unfortunate experience of breaking a plate, bowl, and glass. It was one of those moments when I felt like the world was against me. I was embarrassed and ashamed of myself, but I knew that I had to own up to my mistake and apologize. 

The first thing I did was to take responsibility for my actions. I admitted that I was the one who broke the items and that it was my fault. I apologized to the person whose items I had broken and offered to replace them. 

The next step was to come up with an excuse for why I had broken the items. I knew that I couldnâ€™t just say that I was clumsy and leave it at that. I had to come up with a more creative excuse that would make sense. 

After some thought, I decided to say that I had been distracted by my phone and had accidentally knocked the items off the table. This was a plausible explanation and it allowed me to take responsibility for my actions without making myself look too bad. 

I also decided to offer to pay for the items I had broken. I knew that this was the right thing to do and it would help show that I was taking responsibility for my actions. 

In the end, I was relieved that I had been able to come up with an excuse for breaking the items. It was a difficult situation, but I was glad that I had been able to take responsibility for my actions and make amends.
