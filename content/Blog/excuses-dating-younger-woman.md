title: Excuses For Dating A Younger Woman
---

As a man in my late thirties, I have often found myself in the position of being interested in dating a younger woman. I know that this is not a typical situation and I understand that there are many people who would criticize me for this. However, I believe that there are some valid excuses for why I have chosen to date a younger woman.

First and foremost, I think it is important to recognize that age is just a number. People of all ages can be compatible and have successful relationships. I think it is important to look beyond the age difference and focus on the qualities of the person. I have found that when I do this, I am able to find someone who I can have a meaningful connection with regardless of their age.

Another excuse for dating a younger woman is that I find them to be more open-minded and adventurous. Younger women tend to be more open to trying new things and exploring different experiences. This is something that I appreciate and enjoy in a relationship.

Finally, I think it is important to recognize that people mature at different rates. Just because someone is younger does not necessarily mean that they are immature. In fact, I have found that some younger women are more mature than their older counterparts. This is something that I find to be incredibly attractive in a partner.

Overall, I think it is important to remember that age is just a number. People of all ages can be compatible and have successful relationships. I think it is important to look beyond the age difference and focus on the qualities of the person. This is why I have chosen to date a younger woman and I believe that there are some valid excuses for doing so.
