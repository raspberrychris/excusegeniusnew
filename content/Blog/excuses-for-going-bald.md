title: Excuses For Going Bald
---

As a man, I understand the importance of having a full head of hair. It can be a source of confidence and a sign of youth and vitality. Unfortunately, for some of us, going bald is a reality that we have to face. While it can be difficult to come to terms with, there are some excuses that you can use to explain why you're going bald. 

1. It's a family trait - Many men experience hair loss due to genetics. If you come from a family of bald men, you can explain that it's simply a trait that has been passed down. 

2. Stress - Stress can be a major factor in hair loss. If you've been dealing with a lot of stress in your life, you can explain that it's the cause of your hair loss. 

3. Medication - Certain medications can cause hair loss as a side effect. If you are taking any medications, you can explain that the hair loss is due to the medication. 

4. Over-styling - If you've been using too much heat or styling products, you can explain that this is the cause of your hair loss. 

5. Age - As we age, our hair tends to thin out. This is a natural process and you can explain that your hair loss is due to age. 

No matter what excuse you use, it's important to remember that hair loss is a natural part of life. There's no need to be embarrassed or ashamed. Embrace your new look and be confident in who you are.
