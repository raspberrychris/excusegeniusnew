title: Excuses For Bruises
---

As a child, I was always getting bruises. Whether it was from playing sports, running around, or just being clumsy, I was always covered in bruises. But as I got older, I found myself having to come up with excuses for why I had so many bruises. 

One of the most common excuses I used was that I had been playing sports. This was usually an easy one to get away with, since I was always playing sports. I would tell my parents that I had been playing football or basketball and that I had gotten a few bruises from it. 

Another excuse I used was that I had been running around. This was also an easy one to get away with, since I was always running around and playing. I would tell my parents that I had been running around and that I had gotten a few bruises from it. 

I also used the excuse that I had been climbing trees. This was a bit more difficult to get away with, since I was usually not allowed to climb trees. But I would tell my parents that I had been climbing trees and that I had gotten a few bruises from it. 

I also used the excuse that I had been playing tag. This was a bit more difficult to get away with, since I was usually not allowed to play tag. But I would tell my parents that I had been playing tag and that I had gotten a few bruises from it. 

Finally, I used the excuse that I had been playing hide and seek. This was also a bit more difficult to get away with, since I was usually not allowed to play hide and seek. But I would tell my parents that I had been playing hide and seek and that I had gotten a few bruises from it. 

These were all the excuses I used to explain why I had so many bruises. While I was usually able to get away with it, I eventually had to come up with a better explanation
