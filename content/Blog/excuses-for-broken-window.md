title: Excuses For A Broken Window
---

I recently had a broken window in my home and it was a stressful situation. I had to figure out how to explain the broken window to my landlord and figure out how to pay for the repairs. It was a difficult situation and I was feeling overwhelmed.

In an effort to make the situation better, I started to come up with excuses for why the window was broken. I knew that I had to come up with something that would be believable and not make me look too irresponsible. Here are some of the excuses I came up with:

1. A strong gust of wind blew the window open and it shattered.

2. A neighborhood kid threw a rock at the window and it broke.

3. I was cleaning the window and the glass broke.

4. A bird flew into the window and shattered it.

5. My pet jumped up and hit the window, breaking it.

6. An earthquake caused the window to break.

7. A tree branch fell on the window and broke it.

8. I was moving furniture and accidentally bumped the window, causing it to break.

These are just a few of the excuses I came up with to explain the broken window. I knew that I had to come up with something believable and that wouldn't make me look too irresponsible. I was relieved when I found an excuse that worked and I was able to explain the broken window to my landlord.

It's important to be honest and take responsibility for your actions. But if you find yourself in a situation where you need an excuse for a broken window, these are some ideas that might help.
