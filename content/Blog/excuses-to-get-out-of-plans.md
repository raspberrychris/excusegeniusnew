title: Excuses To Get Out Of Plans
---

I'm sure we've all been there: you've made plans to do something with friends, family, or a significant other, and then suddenly you realize you'd rather do anything else. Whether you're just feeling lazy or you have something more important to do, there are times when you need to make an excuse to get out of plans. 

If you're looking for a way to get out of plans without hurting anyone's feelings, here are some excuses you can use:

1. "I'm not feeling well." This is a classic excuse that often works. You can say you have a headache, stomachache, or any other kind of ache that will make it impossible for you to go out. 

2. "I have to work late." If you have a job, this is a great excuse. You can say that you have to stay late at work or that you have an important project that needs to be done. 

3. "I'm exhausted." This is another great excuse, especially if you've been busy lately. You can say that you're too tired to go out and need to rest. 

4. "I have other plans." If you don't want to tell the truth, you can say that you already have plans with someone else. This way, you don't have to lie but you also don't have to reveal what you're really doing. 

5. "I'm not in the mood." This is a great excuse if you just don't feel like going out. You can say that you're not in the mood for whatever it is that you were planning to do. 

6. "I have to study." If you're a student, this is a great excuse. You can say that you have a test coming up or that you need to study for an upcoming exam. 

7. "I have to take care of something."
