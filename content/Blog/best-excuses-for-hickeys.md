title: Best Excuses For Hickeys
---

As someone who has had to deal with hickeys, I know how embarrassing they can be. It can be hard to come up with an excuse that sounds believable, but it's not impossible. Here are some of the best excuses for hickeys that I have come up with.

1. An allergic reaction: This is a great excuse because it's believable and it's not too far-fetched. All you have to do is say that you had an allergic reaction to something and the hickey was the result.

2. You got hit by a door: This is another good excuse because it's believable and it's not too far-fetched either. All you have to do is say that you were walking through a door and it hit you in the neck and left a mark.

3. You fell on something: This is another great excuse because it's believable and it's not too far-fetched either. All you have to do is say that you fell on something and it left a mark on your neck.

4. You were playing sports: This is another great excuse because it's believable and it's not too far-fetched either. All you have to do is say that you were playing a sport and you got hit in the neck and it left a mark.

5. You were in a fight: This is another great excuse because it's believable and it's not too far-fetched either. All you have to do is say that you were in a fight and you got hit in the neck and it left a mark.

These are some of the best excuses for hickeys that I have come up with. I hope that these excuses help you out if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to explain a hickey. Just remember to be creative and think of something that is believable and not too far-fetched.
