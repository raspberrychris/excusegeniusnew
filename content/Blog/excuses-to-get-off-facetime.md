title: Excuses To Get Off Facetime
---

I'm sure we've all been there: you're on a Facetime call with someone and you just want to get off. Maybe you're feeling tired, or you just don't have anything more to talk about. Whatever the reason, it can be hard to figure out how to end the call without being too abrupt.

Fortunately, there are plenty of excuses you can use to get off Facetime without making it too obvious. Here are some of my favorites:

1. "I'm sorry, I have to go. I just remembered I have to do something."

This is a classic excuse that can work in almost any situation. It's vague enough that you don't have to explain yourself, but it's polite enough that the other person won't be too offended.

2. "I'm sorry, I just got a text/call from someone else that I need to take care of."

This excuse is great because it implies that you have something important to take care of, so you can't stay on the call any longer. It also implies that you're a popular person who gets a lot of calls and texts.

3. "I'm sorry, I'm really tired and I need to get some rest."

This excuse is perfect if you're feeling exhausted and just need to take a break. It's polite and understanding, and it's hard for the other person to argue with.

4. "I'm sorry, I just remembered I have an appointment/meeting/errand to run."

This excuse is great if you need to get off the call quickly. It implies that you have something important to do, and it's hard for the other person to argue with.

5. "I'm sorry, I have to go now. I'll talk to you later!"

This excuse is great if you just need to end the call without making a big deal
