title: Excuses For Not Kissing Someone
---

I'm sure we've all been there: you're out on a date with someone you like, but you don't want to kiss them. It can be a tricky situation, and it's hard to know what to say. But don't worry, there are plenty of excuses you can use to avoid kissing someone.

First of all, you can always say that you're not ready yet. This is a perfectly valid excuse, and it's one that your date will likely understand. You don't have to explain why you're not ready; just let them know that you need more time.

Another excuse is that you don't want to rush things. This is also a valid excuse, and it shows that you respect your date's feelings. You don't want to move too quickly and make them uncomfortable.

You can also say that you're not feeling well. This is a great excuse because it's hard for your date to argue with. If you're feeling sick, it's understandable that you don't want to kiss someone.

Finally, you can always say that you're not comfortable with it yet. This is a great excuse because it shows that you're taking your time and not rushing into anything. It also shows that you respect your date's feelings and boundaries.

No matter what excuse you use, it's important to be honest and respectful. Your date will appreciate it if you're honest with them about why you don't want to kiss them. Just make sure that you don't use any of these excuses too often, or your date might start to get suspicious.
