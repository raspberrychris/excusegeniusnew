title: Excuses For Having A Black Eye
---

As someone who has had a black eye in the past, I know how embarrassing it can be. People always seem to ask the same questions: "What happened?" or "Did someone hit you?" It can be difficult to come up with a good excuse for why you have a black eye.

To avoid the awkwardness of explaining why you have a black eye, here are some excuses you can use:

1. "I was playing a sport and got hit in the face."

This excuse is a classic. It's a great way to explain away a black eye without having to get into too much detail. Plus, it's totally plausible.

2. "I accidentally bumped into a door."

This is another classic excuse that is easy to explain away. It's also believable since it's easy to accidentally bump into a door and get a black eye.

3. "I was wrestling with my brother/sister/friend and they accidentally hit me in the face."

This excuse is perfect if you don't want to admit that you got into a fight. It's also a believable excuse since it's easy to accidentally get hit in the face when wrestling.

4. "I was trying to do a trick on my skateboard/bike and I fell."

This is a great excuse if you're an adrenaline junkie. It's also believable since it's easy to fall off a skateboard or bike and get a black eye.

5. "I was in a car accident."

This is a great excuse if you don't want to admit that you got into a fight. It's also believable since it's easy to get a black eye in a car accident.

No matter what excuse you choose, make sure that you stick to it. That way, you don't have to worry about coming up with a different story every time someone asks you about your black eye
