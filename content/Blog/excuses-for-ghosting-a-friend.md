title: Excuses For Ghosting A Friend
---

I recently had to ghost a friend and it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. I felt so guilty and I knew it was going to hurt them, but I had to do it for my own mental health. 

I know that ghosting someone is never the right thing to do, but sometimes it's the only thing you can do. It's a difficult decision to make and it's something I wouldn't wish on anyone. 

When I ghosted my friend, I had to come up with excuses for why I was suddenly disappearing from their life. Here are some of the excuses I used: 

1. I'm really busy with work and don't have time to keep in touch. 

2. I'm going through a difficult time and need some space. 

3. I'm dealing with a lot of personal issues and need to focus on myself. 

4. I'm taking a break from social media and need to stay away from it for a while. 

5. I'm moving away and won't be able to keep in touch. 

6. I'm dealing with a lot of stress and need to take a break from people. 

7. I'm going through a tough time and need to focus on my mental health. 

These are just some of the excuses I used to ghost my friend. I know it was wrong and I felt guilty about it, but I had to do it for my own wellbeing. 

I know it's not easy to ghost someone, but sometimes it's the only way to protect yourself. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to ghost someone, make sure you come up with a good excuse and be honest with them. It won't make it any easier, but it will help them understand why you had to do it.
