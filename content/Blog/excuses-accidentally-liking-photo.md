title: Excuses For Accidentally Liking A Photo
---

I recently had an embarrassing moment on Instagram when I accidentally liked a photo. It was an old photo of someone I hadn't seen in years and I was so embarrassed that I had liked it.

The first thing I did was to quickly unlike the photo. But then I realized that the person I had liked the photo of might have seen the notification that I had liked it. I was so embarrassed and I didn't know what to do.

I decided to come up with some excuses for why I had liked the photo in the first place. Here are some of the excuses I came up with:

1. I was just scrolling through my feed and I accidentally double tapped the photo.

2. I was trying to get to the next photo and I accidentally liked the one I was on.

3. My finger slipped and I accidentally liked the photo.

4. I was trying to comment on the photo and I accidentally liked it instead.

5. I was just trying to look at the photo more closely and I accidentally liked it.

6. My phone was acting up and it liked the photo without me meaning to.

7. I was just trying to show someone else the photo and I accidentally liked it.

I hope these excuses will help me explain why I liked the photo in the first place. I know it was an embarrassing mistake, but hopefully it won't happen again.
