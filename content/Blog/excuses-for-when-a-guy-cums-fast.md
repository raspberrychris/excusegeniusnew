title: Excuses For When A Guy Cums Fast
---

I'm sure many guys have been in the situation where they cum too fast. It can be embarrassing and frustrating, and it can make you feel like you're not living up to your partner's expectations. But don't worry, it's a common problem and there are ways to fix it. 

The first thing to do is to understand why it's happening. It could be due to stress, anxiety, or even just inexperience. Whatever the reason, it's important to recognize it and address it. 

Once you understand the cause, you can start to work on improving your stamina. This could mean trying different positions, taking breaks, or even just practicing breathing exercises. It's also important to make sure you're relaxed and comfortable during sex. 

If you're still struggling, there are also medications and supplements that can help. Talk to your doctor about your options and see if they can recommend something that could help. 

If the problem persists, it's important to be honest with your partner. Explain the situation and let them know that you're working on it. They'll appreciate your honesty and it will help you feel more comfortable in the bedroom. 

Finally, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone has their own unique challenges and it's important to remember that it's not a reflection of your worth as a partner. 

At the end of the day, it's important to remember that sex should be enjoyable for both of you. If you're having trouble with premature ejaculation, don't be afraid to talk to your partner and work together to find a solution.
