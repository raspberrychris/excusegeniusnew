title: Excuses For Having A Lighter
---

I'm sure we've all been there - you're out with friends and you need to light a cigarette, but you don't have a lighter. It's an embarrassing situation, and you don't want to be the one who has to ask for a light. So, what do you do? You make excuses. 

Here are some of the excuses I've used in the past when I didn't have a lighter: 

1. "My lighter ran out of fuel." This is a classic excuse, and it's one that I've used many times. It's a believable excuse because it's true - lighters do run out of fuel eventually. 

2. "I left my lighter at home." This is also a plausible excuse, and it's one that I've used many times. It's a believable excuse because it's easy to forget to bring a lighter with you when you leave the house. 

3. "I don't smoke." This is a good excuse if you don't want to admit that you do smoke. It's also a believable excuse because it's true - not everyone smokes. 

4. "My lighter is broken." This is a believable excuse because it's true - lighters do break. It's also a good excuse if you don't want to admit that you do smoke. 

5. "I don't have a lighter." This is a good excuse if you don't want to admit that you do smoke. It's also a believable excuse because it's true - not everyone carries a lighter. 

These are just some of the excuses I've used in the past when I didn't have a lighter. I'm sure there are many more excuses out there, so if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to light a cigarette but don't have a lighter, don't panic - just come up with a believable excuse and you'll be fine
