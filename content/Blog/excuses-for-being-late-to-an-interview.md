title: Excuses For Being Late To An Interview
---

I recently had the unfortunate experience of being late to an important job interview. I was so embarrassed and felt terrible about it, but I knew I had to explain myself. Here are some of the excuses I used to explain why I was late to my interview.

1. Traffic: This is a classic excuse for being late to an interview. I explained that I had left early, but the traffic was so bad that I couldn't make it on time.

2. Lost: I told the interviewer that I had gotten lost on the way to the interview and that I had to take a few wrong turns before I could find the right address.

3. Car Trouble: I explained that my car had broken down on the way to the interview and that I had to wait for a tow truck to arrive.

4. Illness: I told the interviewer that I had been feeling ill and that I had to take a few extra minutes to make sure I was feeling better before I arrived.

5. Wrong Time: I explained that I had written down the wrong time for the interview and that I had arrived at the wrong time.

These are just a few of the excuses I used to explain why I was late to my interview. I hope that by being honest and providing an explanation, the interviewer was able to understand my situation and forgive me for being late.
